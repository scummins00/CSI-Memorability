# Analysing the  Memorability of a Procedural Crime-Drama TV Series
We investigate the memorability of a 5 season span of a popular crime-drama TV series, CSI, through the application of a vision transformer fine-tuned on the task of video-memorability prediction. By investigating the popular genre of crime-drama TV through the use of a detailed annotated corpus combined with memorability scores, we show how to extrapolate meaning from the memorability scores generated on video shots. We perform a quantitative analysis to relate shot memorability to a variety of aspects of the show.
